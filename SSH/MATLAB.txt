From the Ground Station:
1. Connect to the RIPLAB2 Wi-Fi network
2. Open Terminal and type
  ssh ros@192.168.0.15
3. If prompted, allow the connection via SSH to the NUC.
4. Then launch ROScore by typing the following command:
  roscore &
5. Launch the SLAM package by typing the following command:
  roslaunch slam slamming.launch &
6. Navigate to the MATLAB directory on the NUC using the following command:
  cd ~/Desktop/Matlab2016b/bin/glnxa64/
7. Launch MATLAB using the following command:
  ./MATLAB -nodisplay -nosplash
8. This will launch MATLAB. In the MATLAB command line navigate to the folder with the script you want to run with the following command:
  cd ~/Folder/path/to/
9. Launch the master ROS node in the MATLAB command line by typing:
  rosinit
10. Launch your script by typing the name of the script in the MATLAB command line:
  scriptname

To transfer files from the Ground Station to the NUC
1. Open Terminal
2. Type the command:
  scp <folder/path/filename> ros@192.168.0.15:<folder/Path/destination>

==================================================================================

To launch MATLAB without Desktop use the following command:
>> matlab -nodisplay -nosplash

The above command will open up the MATLAB terminal and allow the input of MATLAB terminal commands.

To launch a MATLAB script without Desktop use the following command:
>> matlab -nodisplay -nosplash < ~/Path/to/script/MyScript.m

This script needs to be in the working directory when MATLAB opens for it to be executed. If the script is not in the working directory, the absolute path to the script may be used.

To transfer files to the remote SSH machine use the following command:
Using just the command line,
