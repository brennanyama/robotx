%Event Handler: Node that will recieve coordinates from mapping, and heading and color from camera. 
%Will send Mission Planner coordinates, heading and color of objects.

%Initializing Lidar variables
arr map[] = 0 %array of coordinates from OGrid
arr object[] = map == 0.9 %value for a coordinate occupied
int a = 2

while(a > 2)

scan = receive(sub) %get set of points after next Lidar scan.
arr map[] = int8[] %assigning map values from OGrid
arr object[]
if  object <= 0 %if no objects found rescan
    scan = receive(sub)
else
    M = min(object) %based on path planner node, distance is from robot to object. Taking closest object
    %rospublish to mission planner node topic; will be moved down wit
    %output from camera. Will ouptut minimum distance. 
end 

%need to get camera inputs, create a loop that will have objects captured in a scan to be processed one at a time.
