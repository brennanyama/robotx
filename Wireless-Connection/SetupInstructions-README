Instructions for setting up Tp-link router:
!!!!NOTE: In order for computers in ROS to communicate you must be connected to router network!!!!!
1. WIRING THE ROUTER:
  - Power cord from Nuc to power outlet(2-prong)
  - Ethernet cable in LAN port of router (port color GOLD) to ethernet port of Nuc
  
2. CONNECTING TO TPLINK: In Network list select "Wired Connection 1" (Can find list on desktop by selecting wifi icon in upper left corner).

3. ENTERING SETUP PAGE: this is to check settings, DHCP client lists, and to reserve addresses, IP & MAC Binding.
 - Go on web browser: type tplink default IP address in address bar: 192.168.0.1
 - If Login page shows: user- admin  password- admin
    *WIRELESS SETTINGS: 
    HINT: keep names consistent throughout ip addressing, host naming and SSID assignments.
       +Wireless Settings: in "Wireless Settings" Tab
          - Wireless Network should be RIPLab; do not change please unless Nathan is notified.
          - You should be able to find wireless tplink as RIPLab, can connect to it after Security settings are configured.
       +Security: in "Wireless Security"
          - checkmark WPA/WPA2 -personal(Recommended)
          - Version: WPA2-PSK
          - Encryption: AES 
          - WIRELESS PASSWORD: Aut0m@tion
          - Hit Save
     *DHCP SETTINGS:
      +DHCP settings: in DHCP Settings Tab
        - can set IP range in start IP and end IP boxes
        - can find and set Default Gateway
      +DHCP Client List: See what device is on the network, find MAC addresses of devices on network
        - Hit refresh to see updated changes as needed.
      +To Set Static IP--Address Reservation: DO NOT USE! It is better to reserve the computer's IP addresses on computer network list on desktop--
        - Hit Wifi symbol in upper lefthand corner: Edit Connections: select RIPLab--select EDIT
        - in IPv4Settings: Method: Manual. Addresses: can add IP address of only computer you are on and its devices here---MAKE SURE THE IP MATCHES HOST FILE IN TERMINAL
              - Address: desired ip of device/computer
              - Netmask: 255.255.255.0 (ALWAYS TYPE THIS)
              - Gateway: same as ip address of computer 
              - After address(s) have been entered, hit save
       *+after making DHCP settings change reboot network by going to system tools: reboot: hit reboot button. 

4. CONNECTING OTHER COMPUTERS AND DEVICES TO RIPLAB:
Note: ROS and Ubuntu keeps a file of various devices, their IP addresses and their hostname(at least on the terminal). 
When on RIPLab network, you can have these devices interact with each other using their hostname. Make sure that IP addresses set to the 
terminal are the same as the ones on this file. Nathan has already added Nuc and Groundstation to this file. Both computers have their host file
with this information.

--file: /etc/hosts
IP Address                Hostname
192.168.0.15              Nuc
192.168.0.100             Groundstation

If somehow you do not see these IPs and host names in this file please add them. Also check that these IPs are assigned to RIPLab.

To open and edit host file:
in terminal enter: sudo vi /etc/hosts
->terminal says: [sudo] password for [user name]:
enter: Aut0m@tion
You might get a page with a disclaimer of a swap file, ignore and hit enter.
Edit file and make sure IPs match on Groundstation and Nuc.
--See vi commands in Vi_Commands file in GIThub to learn how to navigate vim text editor, which is what we are using to edit the host file. DONOT USE GEDIT!!!


To Check and add IPs to RIPlLab: 
  - go to edit connections in network lists
  - select RIPLab and EDIT
  - in IPv4Settings tab: make sure Method is "manaual"
    - check if desired IP is listed 
    - if not click Add, type IP, NETMASK is always 255.255.255.0, Gateway is same as IP.
    - Hit save 
  - This only needs to be done for the computer you are physically using. 
 
5. Testing Communication:
Now Nuc and Groundstation should be connected to the network and able to communicate.

To test this:
- (testing User computer) in terminal enter: Ping [your computer's host name on host file]
- If it works you should see the terminal say:"64 bytes from [computer you are pinging] ([computer's IP]): icmp_seq=[1] ttl=64 time=0.015ms"
it makes a continuous list of this, to end press ctrl c. 

- If it doesn't work terminal should be making same list except is says HOST is unreachable and/or gives an error.

- (testing communication with other computer) in terminal enter: Ping [enter other computer]. 

For Troubleshooting: follow directions above to see if the listed actions were done, or see troubleshooting file on GIThub,
or call Nathan at 808-627-2147.

**Please note the error somewhere, so it can be tracked, followed by Nathan, and added to troubleshoot page.**
  
 SSH INSTRUCTIONS
 To login from ground station to nuc, 
 1. open terminal on ground station
 2. type "ssh ros@nuc"
 3. enter password
 4. you did it, enjoy it!
