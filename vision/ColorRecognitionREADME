Color Recognition

Setup: 
Must have MATLAB and Computer Vision System Toolbox installed

Troubleshooting: 
If problems with the webcam arise, first check that MATLAB can "see" the webcam
        Type 'webcamlist' into the command window and a list of the available webcams should appear
        Ensure that the code is referring to the correct webcam if more than one is listed
                Ex: If the results of the 'webcamlist' show that the 'HD Logitech C920 Pro' is the second webcam listed, 
                ensure that the code references ('linuxvideo',2)

Codes: 
HSVNov15RedOnlyMorph.m
        Color(s): Red 
        Input(s): Live-stream video from the webcam
        Output(s): areaRed, centroidRed, bboxRed
                The outputs are determined using Blob Analysis in MATLAB: https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/blobanalysis.html 
                        areaRed: Vector that the number of pixels in labeled regions of red
                        centroidRed: M-by-2 matrix of centroid coordinates, where M represents the number of red blobs
                        bboxRed: M-by-4 matrix of [x y width height] red bounding box coordinates, where M represents the number
                                of red blobs and [x y] represents the upper left corner of the bounding box
