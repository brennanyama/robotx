function BMBF_preliminary

    % Get location information (current position (x,y), and current heading (psi)
    
    % Look at camera to determine where the targets are
    
        % If you can see the targets, move on
        % If you can't see the targets, spin
    
    % Calculate heading realitve to the mean (middle) of the targets
    
    % Drive forward at constant velocity (maybe 50% or so), and control
    % heading (via PWM) to targets
