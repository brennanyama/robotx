remote_control_with_interrupt_readme

Requires:
Arduino Mega
RX and TX from Futaba

This code should be able to handle the basic remote control functions. 

Currently able to use the left joystick for forward and reverse. The right joystick is used for rotation. It is designed to be used with the modified holonomic drive we are planning to use.

On the Mega, the pin set up is as follows:

	Pin 3,4,5 should go to the RX
	Pin 18 should go to power on the RX for the interrupt
	Pin 11(optional) is just for testing the interrupt
	Pin 12,8,9,10 go to the motor controllers for 1,2,3,4 respectively
